  desc: Functions to load brainvr-framework data. Genreally split into two categories of functions. 
    Loading and opening. The loading functions (with the expection of load_experiment/s) take exact
    filepath to the object to be loaded. The opening functions take a folder and log name (e.g. "results")
    and perform both searching and loading for a particular log. This is done so you don't have
    to write your own regex searches for specific files. The opening functions are usually in both
    plural (open_brainvr_logs) and singular versions. The singualr expect a single log of a particular
    type to exist (given folder, name and optinally timestamp), otherwise they throw error and return NULL
    The plural versions load all logs of given type.
